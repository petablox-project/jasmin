ISSUE:

Manifestation of the problem: 
   Booster worked fine on Mac Java7 and also on fir machines with Java7
   It failed with Java6 on the fir machines with a crash while writing the class files after
       inlining reflective calls.

Solution:
   Downloaded source zip for java_cup from https://github.com/Sable/java_cup.git
   Modified build.xml to set source and target jvm as 1.6
   Modified lines 11 and 12 of file java_cup-develop/src/java_cup/runtime/SyntaxTreeDFS.java
     as there was a compilation error.
     Original code:
         private HashMap<String, ElementHandler> preMap = new HashMap<>();
         private HashMap<String, ElementHandler> postMap = new HashMap<>();
     Modified code:
         private HashMap<String, ElementHandler> preMap = new HashMap<String, ElementHandler>();
         private HashMap<String, ElementHandler> postMap = new HashMap<String, ElementHandler>();
